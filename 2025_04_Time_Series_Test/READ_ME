The second test mission for sg175 to check its abilities before the Spring Time Series (2025).

Deployed in Shilshole Bay for one day and completed 6 dives. 

** unfinished but saving for progress **
This is the folder for the Time Series Test Mission deployed off in the Puget Sound near Shilshole Bay. 

This folder contains a meta_data file and the mission plan.

The clean_data folder has csv and netCDF files that are corrected with a time and depth offset and fewer renamed variables for simplicity in plotting. The raw data can still be found in raw_files > nc_files > the last file titled sg194_Carson_Shilshole_Overnight_timeseries.nc
The clean_data folder also has csv and netCDF files for the depth averaged currents and finally a python script detailing the process for cleaning the data.

The raw_files folder has all the raw files that come off the basestation. These are sorted by file type. 

For any questions about this mission please contact the Mission PI, Katie Kohlman (kohlman@uw.edu), or the Data Manager, Lydia Kelley (lydiagk@uw.edu).

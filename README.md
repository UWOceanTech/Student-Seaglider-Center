SSC Seaglider Mission Data: 
The University of Washington Student Seaglider Center (SSC) manages a fleet of Seagliders for student-directed research. Assisted by experienced mentors, students conduct technical testing, dive planning, and piloting. The goal of the project is to create an opportunity for undergraduate students to get hands-on experience with oceanographic reasearch and to produce meaningful data that is accessable and significant in the Oceanographic community.

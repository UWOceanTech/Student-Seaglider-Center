This is the folder for the Student Seaglider Center's Elliot Bay Day Deployment for the UW College of the Environment BIG10 commercial. 
Seaglider 195 was deployed off the R/V Rachel Carson in the Puget Sound near Elliot Bay on May 17th, 2025 for 3 dives. 

This folder contains a meta_data file and the mission plan.

The clean_data folder has csv and netCDF files that are corrected for the time offset and fewer renamed variables for simplicity in plotting. The raw data can still be found in raw_files > nc_files > the last file titled sg195_Elliot_Bay_BIG10__17May2024_timeseries.nc
The clean_data folder also has csv and netCDF files for the depth averaged currents and finally a python script detailing the process for cleaning the data.

The raw_files folder has all the raw files that come off the basestation. These are sorted by file type. 

For any questions about this mission please contact the Mission PI, Katie Kohlman (kohlman@uw.edu), or the Data Manager, Sophie Monterola (somont@uw.edu).

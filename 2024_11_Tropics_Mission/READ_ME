This is the folder for the Student Seaglider Center's Tropics Mission deployed off the R/V Sikuliaq with the MOTIVE Cruise in the Pacific Ocean at the Equator at 140W. 
Glider 195 was deployed in the Pacific Ocean on November 19th, 2024 and recovered on June 5th, 2025.
Originally was planned to reach Honolulu, but mechanical difficulties altered the Glider's trajectory and needed to be recovered. 

This folder contains a meta_data file and the mission plan.

The clean_data folder has csv and netCDF files that are corrected with a time and depth offset and fewer renamed variables for simplicity in plotting. The raw data can still be found in raw_files > nc_files > the last file titled sg195_MOTIVE_2024_timeseries.nc
The clean_data folder also has csv and netCDF files for the depth averaged currents and finally a python script detailing the process for cleaning the data.

The raw_files folder has all the raw files that come off the basestation. These are sorted by file type. 

For any questions about this mission please contact the Mission PI, Katie Kohlman (kohlman@uw.edu), or the Data Manager, Sophie Monterola (somont@uw.edu).

Seaglider (sg194) Deployment off the Rachel Carson R/V. Deployed in the Puget Sound near Shilshole Bay. 
Intended to be an overnight deployment from 04/30/2024 - 05/01/2024 but the mission was cut short in the late afternoon after 22 dives because of buoyancy issues causing the glider to fly poorly.

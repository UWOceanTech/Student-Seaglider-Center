This is the folder for the Student Seaglider Center's 2024 Shilshole Shakedown. 
Gliders 194 & 195 were deployed in Shilshole Bay, Puget Sound on April 5th, 2024 and retrieved on April 5th, 2024.
This was the Student Seaglider Center's first two glider deployment.

Inside each subfolder, sg194 & sg195, there is the respective meta data file.

The clean_data folder has csv and netCDF files that are corrected for the time offset and fewer renamed variables for simplicity in plotting. The raw data can still be found in raw_files > nc_files > the last file titled  glider_name_April_2024_Shilshole_Test_timeseries.nc
The clean_data folder also has csv and netCDF files for the depth averaged currents and finally a python script detailing the process for cleaning the data.

The raw_files folder has all the raw files that come off the basestation. These are sorted by file type.

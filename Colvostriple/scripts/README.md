General Scripts for UWSSC should be added here and commented upon such that theycan be read and executed from any member.

For .sh (shell) scripts, simply navigate to the directory where your .sh file is located on your local machine in terminal, then type ./your_script.sh and hit enter.
If you get a permissions issue, run this before executing: chmod +x /path/to/yourscript.sh     (this adds excecute permissions to the file)

This is the folder for the Student Seaglider Center's February 2025 Shilshole Test Dive. 
Glider 175 was deployed in the Puget Sound on Feburary 2nd, 2025 and recovered on Feburary 2nd, 2025. 
The first test mission for sg175 to check its abilities before the Spring Time Series (2025).

This folder contains a meta_data file and the mission plan.

The clean_data folder has csv and netCDF files that are corrected with a time and depth offset and fewer renamed variables for simplicity in plotting. The raw data can still be found in raw_files > nc_files > the last file titled sg175_TimeSeriesTest_timeseries.nc
The clean_data folder also has csv and netCDF files for the depth averaged currents and finally a python script detailing the process for cleaning the data.

The raw_files folder has all the raw files that come off the basestation. These are sorted by file type. 

For any questions about this mission please contact the Mission PI, Katie Kohlman (kohlman@uw.edu), or the Data Manager, Lydia Kelley (lydiagk@uw.edu).
